# MTG-Scoreboard
### An authenticated, virtual white board to track you and a friend's 1v1 commander games!

<p>MTG Scoreboard is a way to record and display your MTG commander games. The inpsiration came from a physical whiteboard in my home that I used to track my games with my roommate.
Users can log in and add their opponent. Then, after each match the host can add who won, what colors/commanders were used, as well as other stats such as win condition and life totals</p>
